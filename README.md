# Hey, I'm semi.
I specialize in keyboard layout analysis and generation. I currently use the [ISRT layout](https://notgate.github.io/layout), 
which I contributed the Linux installation for. 

I'm working on my own generated keyboard layout, as well as Keynergy - a new approach 
to layout analysis.

I use Void Linux, BSPWM, and Emacs.

If you want to contact me, feel free to message semi#5753 on Discord or @semilin0:matrix.org on Matrix.
