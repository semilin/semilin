# Hey, I'm semi.

I specialize in keyboard layout analysis and generation. I'm the creator of the [Semimak keyboard layout](https://semilin.github.io/semimak), using my [genkey](https://semilin.github.io/genkey). I'm currently experimenting with new ideas for efficient and extensible layout analysis. The most usable prototype of these ideas is [layoup](https://github.com/semilin/layoup), an analyzer written in and extensible with Common Lisp. I'm currently working on [keycat](https://github.com/semilin/keycat), a low-level library for layout analysis designed for maximum performance without compromising on flexibility. 

I currently use Guix System, Emacs, and Qtile.
