# Hey, I'm semi.
I specialize in keyboard layout analysis and generation. I'm the creator of the [Semimak keyboard layout](https://semilin.github.io/semimak), using my [genkey](https://github.com/semilin/genkey), and I'm currently working on Keynergy - a new approach 
to layout analysis.

I currently use NixOS, Emacs, and EXWM.

If you want to contact me, feel free to message semi#5753 on Discord or @semilin0:matrix.org on Matrix.
