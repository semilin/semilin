# Hey, I'm semi.

I specialize in keyboard layout analysis and generation. I'm the creator of the [Semimak keyboard layout](https://semilin.github.io/semimak), using my [genkey](https://semilin.github.io/genkey). I'm currently experimenting with new ideas for efficient and extensible layout analysis. I'm working on [keycat](https://github.com/semilin/keycat), a low-level library for layout analysis designed for maximum performance without compromising on flexibility, as well as [keymui](https://github.com/semilin/keymui), a cross-platform graphical layout analyzer powered by keycat. 

I currently use Arch, Emacs, and River.
